This folder contains my solution notebook used during the [Zero to GANs - Human Protein Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jovian-pytorch-z2g) 
Kaggle Competition. This is a multi-class, multi-label image classification challenge of human proteins in microscopic images. 

I used a custom CNN in this competition. F-score was used as the metric for this competition. 
My public and private scores were 0.70191 and 0.68905, respectively. 

The notebook can be run using a Kaggle kernel from the competition page.
