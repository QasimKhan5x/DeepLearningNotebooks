This folder contains my notebook for the [Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000) dataset.
The dataset contains images of pigmented skin lesions. This notebook can be run in a Kaggle kernel containing this dataset.

The goal is to create a multi-class image classifier for these images. 
I used a pretrained denseent that achieved 90% accuracy.
